# Hava (Haskell AVAnza parser)

Hava is a Haskell-based tool designed for personal use, primarily to analyze
stock transactions exported from Avanza. It allows users, especially individual
investors, to easily overview how different companies in their portfolio are
performing. By parsing Avanza's exported CSV files, Hava provides insights
into investment.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
- Haskell
- Stack

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `stack setup` to set up the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler).
4. Build the project using `stack build`.

## Usage
Run Hava using the command `stack run hava-exe -- [options]`. Replace
`[options]` with the specific commands or file paths as needed. 


Running `stack run hava-exe -- --help` will provide the different options and
the arguments needed for those options. One of the more useful commands is
`--group-by-company` which can be ran with `stack run hava-exe --
--group-by-company <path-to-csv-file>`

## Future Enhancements
New features and enhancements will be added as needed. Stay tuned for updates!
